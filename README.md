Real-time Integrated Search Service for Second-hand Trading Platforms

Developed a big data pipeline using Hadoop for:

Collecting, processing, storing, and managing data.
Visualizing meaningful insights derived from the results.
Identified a market gap:

While second-hand products are traded across multiple platforms, there is no unified service for price comparison, unlike for new products.
Created a "Real-Time Unified Search Service for Second-Hand Trading Platforms" to address this issue:

Enables users to conveniently compare prices.
Helps users make informed purchasing decisions in real-time.
