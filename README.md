Real-time Integrated Search Service for Second-hand Trading Platforms

Our team developed a big data pipeline using Hadoop for collecting, processing, storing, and managing data, and visualized meaningful insights from the results. Recognizing the lack of a unified service for comparing prices of second-hand products across multiple platforms—unlike new products—we created a "Real-Time Unified Search Service for Second-Hand Trading Platforms" to address this gap. This service enables users to conveniently compare prices and make informed purchasing decisions in real-time.
