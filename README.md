# Real-Time Unified Search Service for Second-Hand Trading Platforms

## Overview
Our project is a comprehensive solution designed to address the lack of a unified service for comparing prices of second-hand products across multiple platforms. Unlike new products, which often have standardized pricing, second-hand items can vary significantly in price and availability. This service allows users to conveniently compare prices in real-time, enabling informed purchasing decisions.

## What the Application Does
The Real-Time Unified Search Service aggregates data from various second-hand trading platforms, providing users with a seamless experience to:
- Compare prices of second-hand products across multiple websites.
- Access real-time updates on product availability and pricing.
- Make informed purchasing decisions based on comprehensive data analysis.

## Why We Used These Technologies
We chose to implement our project using Hadoop for several reasons:
- **Scalability**: Hadoop can handle large volumes of data across distributed systems, making it ideal for aggregating information from various sources.
- **Data Processing**: The Hadoop ecosystem provides robust tools for processing and managing big data, allowing us to efficiently analyze and visualize insights.
- **Flexibility**: The ability to integrate with various data sources and formats makes Hadoop a suitable choice for our diverse dataset from multiple platforms.

## Challenges Faced
During the development of this project, we encountered several challenges:
- **Data Integration**: Aggregating data from multiple platforms required overcoming various API limitations and data formatting issues.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Ensuring that the data was updated in real-time posed significant technical hurdles, particularly in terms of system performance and latency.
- **User Experience**: Designing an intuitive interface that allows users to easily navigate and compare products was a critical focus, requiring extensive user testing and feedback.

## Future Enhancements
Looking ahead, we aim to implement the following features:
- **Expanded Platform Support**: Integrate additional second-hand trading platforms to broaden the range of products available for comparison.
- **Advanced Filtering Options**: Provide users with more sophisticated filters to refine their search results based on criteria such as location, condition, and seller ratings.
- **User Accounts and Notifications**: Enable users to create accounts to save their searches and receive notifications about price changes or new listings for their desired products.
