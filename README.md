# Real-Time Unified Search Service for Second-Hand Trading Platforms <br><be>

## Overview
Our project is a comprehensive solution designed to address the lack of a unified service for comparing prices of second-hand products across multiple platforms. Unlike new products, which often have standardized pricing, second-hand items can vary significantly in price and availability. This service, implemented using **Hadoop** for its scalability and data processing capabilities, allows users to compare prices in real-time, enabling informed purchasing decisions conveniently.<br><br>

## What the Application Does
- Compare prices of second-hand products across multiple websites.
- Access real-time updates on product availability and pricing.
- Make informed purchasing decisions based on comprehensive data analysis.<br><br>

## Challenges Faced
- **Data Integration**: Aggregating data from multiple platforms required overcoming various API limitations and data formatting issues.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Ensuring that the data was updated in real-time posed significant technical hurdles, particularly in terms of system performance and latency.<br><br>
